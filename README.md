# Anonymized_KNN_Analysis

Project Overview: Presented with an anonymized data set (no labels for any of the columns) try and classify the different data points.

Because this is not a very complex dataset the data was almost instantly ready to be put into a KNN classifier. The main challenge was because I dont know exactly what I am classfying it is hard to discern the n_neighbors. Ultimately this value was achieved by iterating through various values and plotting out the total error of the model for each one. Looking at all these iterations on a graph allowed us to easily see which value was best.

Through trial and error the intial accuracy of the model which around 74% was increased all the up to 84%.
